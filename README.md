# Robot Car Project

This repository contains the development files for two robot platforms designed and built by Team HOPE. These robots demonstrate advanced mobility, object manipulation, and vision-based control using embedded systems and computer vision.

## ü§ñ Robots Overview

### üõû Robot 1 ‚Äì Mecanum Drive Robot
- Four-wheel Mecanum drive for omnidirectional movement.
- Vacuum suction mechanism for object pickup and manipulation.
- Gear-driven lifting mechanism for vertical object placement.
- Controlled by ESP32, integrated with Raspberry Pi for computer vision and task coordination.

### ‚ö´ Robot 2 ‚Äì Line Following Robot
- Two-wheel differential drive system.
- Line-following capability using IR sensors and basic lane detection.
- Vacuum-assisted pickup with a robotic arm.
- **Robotic arm mechanism controlled by Raspberry Pi via servo motors.**
- Onboard ESP32 for navigation and low-level actuation.

## üß† Key Features

- **Omnidirectional movement** using Mecanum wheels (Robot 1).
- **Autonomous line following** and precise turning (Robot 2).
- **Vacuum-based object manipulation** integrated into both robots.
- **Gear lifting mechanism** for elevation-based tasks (Robot 1).
- **Serial communication** between Raspberry Pi and ESP32.
- **Raspberry Pi-controlled robotic arm** using PWM for servo control.
- **Real-time object and color detection** using OpenCV and Python.

## üñ•Ô∏è Vision System

- Initial object detection using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model.
- Transitioned to OpenCV for real-time color and blob detection.
- Vision logic optimized for Raspberry Pi performance.
- Debugging included detection accuracy, color calibration, and frame sync issues.
- Reliable serial communication between Pi and ESP32 enabled command synchronization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware & Control

- ESP32 used for low-level motor and vacuum control.
- Raspberry Pi used for:
  - High-level vision and decision-making
  - **Robotic arm control via servo motor signals**
- Servo motors controlled via GPIO PWM for precise movements.
- Vacuum suction activated based on detection and arm position.
- Modular design with clean separation of software and hardware responsibilities.
